ASSIGNMENT - 3

1) Given a class named patient, identify what instance methods could be written in this class.
-> Instance methods in patients are 
	- Create a profile for patient or if created previously then ask for patient ID
	- Check for the disease for which the patient has come
	- If he had previously for same issue then check the progression in recovery of that disease
	- If any scanning is required, then proceed with that scanning etc.
	- If any surgery is required, then proceed with that surgery
	- If the disease is curable with medicines, then give them the prescription of required medicine

2) Given a class named CPU, identify the public & private instance members.
-> Public Instance Member
	- Plugging in pen drive to install some software, watch movies, etc
	- Inserting USB/HDMI cables to interface with other devices
	- Inserting CD to watch movies, play games, listen to music, etc
	- Plugging in Led lights to make CPU to make it look attractive

   Private Instance Member
	- Processing of CPU, as it can do multiple tasks like fetching data, decode the data, execute the data
	  and write back or give the output to user
	- Design and configuration of CPU is also a private instance member

	These are some of the Private Instance Member of CPU as we can't access it publically as it comes with CPU

3) Given a class named Media, assume there are 3 objects of this class. Identify the static members of this class. 
-> The three objects of media are print media, broadcast media, social media

   Static Members of Media Class
	- In print media, once the content is printed on paper then it can't be changed even if changes are required in them.

4) Given a class named Calculator & its derived classes named Standard and Scientific, identify the method which can be overridden 
   by the derived classes.
-> The normal calculator and scientific calculator contain some common methods including:
	- Addition()
	- Subtraction()
	- Division()
	- Multiplication()

5) Given the classes Bird, Superman, Aeroplane and Missile, identify the usage of interfaces here. 
-> Interfaces here are
	- The common interfaces for all the class are "flight."
	- Bird and superman can have interfaces like, they both are living things so food, oxygen, shelter.
	- Common interfaces between aeroplane and missile would be fuel,operator
